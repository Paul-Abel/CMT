# Content Management System

This is a project work for the university. The goal is to show what is possible with JSF and Primefaces. 

To demonstrate this, I have created a small content management system. This manages various magazines and publishers with different attributes. 

This is not a finished or standardized product but only a proof of concept to show what is possible with JSF. However, it offers the possibility to add corresponding attributes and functionalities. However, this would only be a laborious task and offers no added value for the goal of this project.
